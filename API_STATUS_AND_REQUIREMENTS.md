# üéØ **ThirstyBird API - Development Status & Requirements**

**Last Updated:** August 24, 2025  
**Repository:** `/thirstybird-platform/thirstybird-api`  
**Current Status:** Core functionality complete, architecture refactoring in progress

---

## **üìä Executive Summary**

The ThirstyBird API is a **voucher platform backend** for the South African market, built with Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis. The core functionality is **90% complete** with all major endpoints implemented and tested. Currently undergoing **architectural refactoring** from direct database queries to proper 3-layer pattern (Controllers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Models).

### **‚úÖ What's Working**
- Complete authentication system with JWT and role-based access
- Venue management with multi-venue profiles  
- Deal creation and management with automatic pricing calculations
- Voucher purchasing with QR code generation
- PayFast payment integration with webhook handling
- Docker development environment with PostgreSQL and Redis
- Rate limiting and security middleware

### **üöß Critical Gaps**
- Email system not implemented (vouchers not delivered to customers)
- No admin panel for platform management
- Testing suite missing
- Architecture refactoring incomplete
- No production deployment strategy

---

## **üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Status**

### **‚úÖ Completed Infrastructure**
```
üìÅ thirstybird-api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üê≥ docker-compose.yml       # PostgreSQL + Redis + Admin UIs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ .env.example            # Environment configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üóÑÔ∏è database/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/            # Schema with proper snake_case
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ seeds/                 # Test data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üì¶ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/              # Connection pooling + Redis client
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/            # Auth, rate limiting, error handling
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validation/            # Joi schemas for input validation
```

### **üöß Architecture Transition (50% Complete)**
**OLD PATTERN:** Route handlers with direct DB queries ‚ùå
```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad: Direct DB queries in routes
router.post('/venues', async (req, res) => {
  const result = await db.query('INSERT INTO venues...');
  res.json(result.rows[0]);
});
```

**NEW PATTERN:** 3-Layer Architecture ‚úÖ
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Proper separation of concerns
router.post('/venues', VenueController.create);
// Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Model ‚Üí Database
```

**Progress:**
- [x] **Models:** `UserModel`, `VenueModel` created
- [x] **Services:** `AuthService`, `VenueService` created  
- [x] **Controllers:** `AuthController`, `VenueController` created
- [ ] **Missing:** Deal, Voucher, Payment layers need refactoring
- [ ] **Integration:** New architecture not fully integrated with main server

---

## **üîê Authentication & Security Status**

### **‚úÖ Implemented**
- JWT token authentication with 7-day expiry
- Role-based access control (customer, venue, admin)

2. **Import Inconsistencies:** Old routes not updated to use new services
3. **Duplicate Code:** Some functionality exists in both old and new patterns
4. **Testing Gap:** No automated testing makes refactoring risky

### **Refactoring Tasks (In Progress)**
- [ ] **Complete Models:** Create `DealModel`, `VoucherModel`, `PaymentModel`
- [ ] **Complete Services:** Create `DealService`, `VoucherService`, `PaymentService`  
- [ ] **Complete Controllers:** Create `DealController`, `VoucherController`, `PaymentController`
- [ ] **Update Routes:** Replace all direct DB calls with controller methods
- [ ] **Remove Old Files:** Clean up original route files after migration
- [ ] **Update Imports:** Fix all service and model imports
- [ ] **Integration Testing:** Ensure refactored code maintains functionality
